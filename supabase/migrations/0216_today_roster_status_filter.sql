-- Migration 0216 · Today's Plan — match the schedule exactly
--
-- The original filter only matched 'scheduled' and 'completed', which
-- silently dropped any shift in 'called_off', 'late', 'vto', or
-- 'no_show' and could leave the card empty when the day's shifts had
-- already drifted off the happy path.
--
-- Drop the status filter entirely: if the schedule shows a row for
-- today with a driver assigned, the today roster shows it.  The status
-- pill on the row tells the dispatcher what state it's in.
